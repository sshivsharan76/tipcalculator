# Problem Statement
Whenever I go out to eat and I’m having a hard time calculating the 
right tip, I’ll
fumble with my phone and search for a “tip calculator” on Google. I couldn’t tell you
the name or the URL of the one I usually end up using, but it’s a simple JavaScript
app. So go ahead and take a swing at making your own tip calculator.
# Tip calculation:
Calculate the tip on the basis of the selected option. The tip can be 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% or 30% based on the quality of service.

Round Tip amount up to two decimal places. Example: 2.48, 23.50, 3:00 (Hint: Math.round () or toFixed (2) )

The calculated tip is shared among all the people mentioned in the number of people to calculate the final share.
